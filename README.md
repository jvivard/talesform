# AI Storybook Creator

An interactive web application that generates personalized children's storybooks with AI-powered text and illustrations. Create unique, engaging stories with consistent characters and beautiful watercolor-style illustrations.

## Features

🖼️ **Consistent Character Illustrations** - Maintain character appearance across all pages
📖 **Interactive Page Flip** - Realistic book-reading experience with smooth page transitions
⚙️ **Secure API Management** - Local storage of API keys for privacy

## How It Works

1. **Enter a Story Prompt** - Describe your story idea (e.g., "A brave little mouse who dreams of becoming a chef")
2. **Set Page Count** - Choose between 1-10 pages for your story
3. **AI Generation** - The app creates:
   - Story structure with detailed character descriptions
   - Cover image with main characters
   - Individual page illustrations with consistent character appearance
